# convert Linux to Windows 10

Note: On GNOME you might have to move the Install Windows 10 Theme.desktop to your ACTUAL desktop to run it!!! But keep the rest of the files in your downloads! Or run this command:

bash ~/Downloads/Convert-Linux-to-Windows-10-main/setupStuff/scripts/ScriptLinuxToWindows10.sh

This script will instantly convert your xfce desktop to a windows 10 like feel. (Now I'm trying to work on supporting other desktop environments!)

also IDK why it's saying its like 98% CSS, I wrote this in 100% bash, the language that Linux uses. Then again, this is my first project, it could be kali's windows 10 theme triggering it. IDK...

You will need to right click the datetime and change the font to **liberation sans size 9** however, if you want a near identical copy. I do not know the commands to do this automatically. (I think I found the commands to do it automatically and updated it!) Feel free to copy my project and add whatever you like to it, or make your own for KDE-plasma or GNOME.

Oh! I found a login screen copy!:

# CHANGE LOG:

I now made it grow the size of the disk to use all available disk space, 

AND I made it reduce the wait-until-online service wait time during boot!
